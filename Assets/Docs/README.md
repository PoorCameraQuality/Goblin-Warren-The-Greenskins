## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2022.x LTS
- .NET 4.x Scripting Runtime
- Git LFS for large assets

### Project Settings
- **Scripting Runtime**: .NET 4.x
- **API Compatibility**: .NET Framework
- **Input Handling**: Both (Old + New Input System)
- **Transparency Sort**: Custom Axis (x=0, y=1, z=0) for isometric depth sorting
- **Fixed Timestep**: 0.02 (50Hz)

### Version Control
- Git repository with comprehensive .gitignore
- Git LFS for large assets (PNG, PSD, WAV, MP3, FBX, UnityPackage)
- Conventional commit messages

## Architecture

### Core Systems
1. **GameManager** - Main game controller and system initialization
2. **ResourceManager** - Resource tracking and management
3. **AIManager** - Unit AI and pathfinding (A* integration)
4. **TaskManager** - Job assignment and task management
5. **BuildingManager** - Construction and building placement
6. **EnemyManager** - Enemy spawning and raid mechanics
7. **UIManager** - User interface and input handling

### Key Features
- Isometric camera with edge scrolling and zoom
- A* pathfinding for all moving entities
- Resource gathering and management
- Building construction system
- Worker AI with state machine
- Enemy raid system
- Hero unit with abilities

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards
- Follow PascalCase for classes and methods
- Use camelCase for variables
- Keep methods small and focused (â‰¤30 lines)
- Use ScriptableObjects for game data
- Maintain loose coupling between systems

### Asset Management
- Use Git LFS for large assets
- Follow Unity naming conventions
- Organize assets in appropriate folders
- Use meta files for asset configuration
