# Goblin Warrens Unity Project - Development Status

## Project Overview
Goblin Warrens is a single-player isometric colony simulator with RTS elements, built in Unity 2022.x LTS using C#.

## Current Project Status

### What's Already Done ✅
- Project structure is set up with proper Unity folders
- Core camera and grid systems are implemented (`IsometricCameraController`, `IsometricGrid`)
- Basic scene debugging and testing infrastructure exists
- ScriptableObject system is initialized (though `TestGroundTile.asset` appears incomplete)
- **GameManager** - Central system coordinator ✅
- **ResourceManager** - Resource tracking and management ✅
- **AIManager** - AI and pathfinding integration ✅
- **UIManager** - Basic UI management ✅
- **EnemyManager** - Enemy spawning and raids ✅
- **TestSceneSetup** - Automated testing system ✅

### What's Missing (Critical Systems) ❌
- **TaskManager** - Job assignment system
- **BuildingManager** - Construction system
- **Unit/WorkerAI** - Basic AI entities
- **Hero System** - Goblin Shaman abilities

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Test Current Systems** (Current Focus)
The core foundation is complete and ready for testing:

- **TestSceneSetup** automatically creates and connects all managers
- **Resource system** with full event-driven architecture
- **AI management** with unit registry and movement coordination
- **Game state management** with pause/resume functionality
- **Enemy system** with raid triggers and spawning

### 2. **Implement Basic AI Framework**
- **Unit base class** - Shared stats and movement API
- **WorkerAI** - State machine for gathering and building
- **TaskManager** - Job assignment system

### 3. **Build Construction System**
- **BuildingManager** - Building placement and construction
- **Enhanced UI** - Resource display and build menu

### 4. **Add Gameplay Loop**
- **Enhanced EnemyManager** - Actual enemy spawning and combat
- **Hero System** - Basic Goblin Shaman abilities

## Testing Instructions

### **Step 1: Create Test Scene**
1. **Create a new scene** in Unity: `File > New Scene > Basic (Built-in)`
2. **Save the scene** as `TestScene` in `Assets/Scenes/`

### **Step 2: Add Test Components**
1. **Add TestSceneSetup script** to an empty GameObject:
   - Create empty GameObject named "TestSetup"
   - Add `TestSceneSetup.cs` component
   - Ensure `Auto Setup On Start` is checked

2. **Add Isometric Camera** (if not already present):
   - Find existing `IsometricCameraController` in the scene
   - Or create new GameObject and add the component from `Assets/Scripts/Core/`

### **Step 3: Run the Test**
1. **Press Play** in Unity
2. **Watch Console** for `[GW]` prefixed messages
3. **Verify initialization** - all managers should initialize successfully

### **Step 4: Test Core Systems**

#### **Resource System Testing:**
- **Press R** - Adds 50 of each resource type
- **Press T** - Removes 25 of each resource type
- **Watch Console** for resource change events
- **Expected**: Resources add/remove with proper validation

#### **Game State Testing:**
- **Press Space** - Toggles pause/resume
- **Press G** - Triggers game over
- **Press Enter** - Restarts the game
- **Watch Console** for state change events
- **Expected**: Time scale changes, state transitions logged

#### **System Integration Testing:**
- **Check Console** for proper initialization sequence
- **Verify** all managers are connected to GameManager
- **Confirm** event subscriptions are working
- **Expected**: Clean initialization with no errors

### **Step 5: Monitor System Behavior**

#### **What to Look For:**
1. **Initialization Sequence:**
   ```
   [GW] === TEST SCENE SETUP STARTING ===
   [GW] Created GameManager
   [GW] Created ResourceManager
   [GW] Created UIManager
   [GW] Created AIManager
   [GW] Created EnemyManager
   [GW] Connected all managers to GameManager
   [GW] Subscribed to manager events
   [GW] === TEST SCENE SETUP COMPLETED ===
   ```

2. **Resource Events:**
   ```
   [GW] ResourceManager initialized with starting resources
   [GW] Wood: 100, Stone: 50, Food: 200, Magic: 25
   [GW] Added 50 Wood (Total: 150)
   [GW] Resource changed: Wood = 150
   ```

3. **Game State Changes:**
   ```
   [GW] Game state changed from Running to Paused
   [GW] Game state changed from Paused to Running
   ```

#### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

**Issue**: Managers not connecting properly
- **Solution**: Check that TestSceneSetup is in the scene and Auto Setup is enabled

**Issue**: Missing references in GameManager
- **Solution**: The TestSceneSetup automatically creates and connects all managers

**Issue**: Console errors about missing components
- **Solution**: Ensure all script files are in the correct folders and compiled

### **Step 6: Advanced Testing**

#### **Resource Threshold Testing:**
1. **Add resources** until total exceeds 500 (default threshold)
2. **Watch for raid trigger** in console
3. **Expected**: EnemyManager should log raid trigger

#### **Performance Testing:**
1. **Monitor frame rate** during resource operations
2. **Check memory usage** in Profiler
3. **Expected**: Smooth performance with minimal overhead

## Development Approach

**Current Status:**
✅ **Core Systems Complete** - Ready for testing and validation
🔄 **Next Phase** - Implement Unit base class and WorkerAI
📋 **Future Work** - Building system and enhanced gameplay

**Why This Order:**
- Core systems provide solid foundation for all gameplay
- Testing validates architecture and integration
- Unit system builds on proven AI management
- Construction system requires working resource and AI systems

## Architecture Notes
- Follow `/docs/technical-reference.md` for coding standards
- Follow `/docs/ArchitectureOverview.md` for system interactions
- Use Unity's built-in namespaces only
- Maintain loose coupling between systems
- All AI movement must use A* Pathfinding Project integration
- All resource changes must go through ResourceManager APIs

## Project Structure
```
/Assets
  /Scripts
    /Core          - Camera, Grid, GameManager, TestSceneSetup
    /Managers      - Resource, AI, Enemy
    /AI           - Unit, WorkerAI, HeroAI (TODO)
    /UI           - UIManager, UI components
    /Buildings    - Building logic and data (TODO)
  /ScriptableObjects - Game data and configurations
  /Docs          - Architecture and technical documentation
```

The project now has a **solid foundation** with all core systems implemented and ready for testing. The TestSceneSetup provides automated testing of the entire system architecture, making it easy to validate functionality before adding new features.
